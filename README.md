# GTU Copilot

*A full-stack academic assistant built for Gujarat Technological University students.*

GTU Copilot is your AI-powered academic sidekick—built specifically for GTU’s assignment-heavy, report-hungry curriculum. It automates the painful parts of student life: writing reports, generating physics models, crafting presentations, clearing doubts, and even “humanizing” AI output so it passes faculty scrutiny.

This is not a generic AI tool. It’s purpose-built for the **exact workflow GTU students follow** across Engineering and Diploma programs.

---

## 🚀 Why This App Exists

GTU students spend **40–100+ hours** every semester writing repetitive reports, watching long YouTube lectures, formatting PDFs, building PPTs, and preparing physics projects.
The truth? Most of this work is mechanical—not meaningful learning.

GTU Copilot removes the mechanical grind so students can focus on actually understanding concepts (or at least getting things submitted on time).

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

* **Engineering students (1st–8th sem)**
* **Diploma students**
* Anyone who needs **GTU-style academic documents**: reports, lab work, physics models, PPTs, viva prep, etc.

---

## 🧱 Core Feature Modules

### 1. **Report Writer**

Generate formal, submission-ready GTU study reports in first-person voice.

**Inputs**

* Subject
* Topic
* Study hours
* Optional video links (for source authenticity)

**Capabilities**

* Auto-structured reports (Intro → Learning Modules → Takeaways → References)
* “Humanize” mode rewrites AI output into natural student-level writing
* No robotic tone, no markdown, no detectable AI patterns
* **One-click DOCX export**

**Harsh Truth:** GTU faculties can detect copy-paste from ChatGPT. This module exists to avoid that.

---

### 2. **Physics Model Generator**

Build complete GTU Physics project documentation—end to end.

**Includes**

* Project idea generator (based on budget + theme)
* Team details organizer (Name, Enrollment No., etc.)
* Full 7-section report (Aim → Principle → Conclusion)
* Auto-generated **schematic diagrams** and **charts** using Gemini image generation
* Final **DOCX export with images included**

If you’ve ever panicked before physics journal submission, this feature is your escape route.

---

### 3. **PPT Maker (Presentation Designer)**

Instantly creates sleek 16:9 HTML5 slides with Tailwind-based styling.

**Capabilities**

* Modern layout
* Live in-app preview
* Auto inclusion of images generated by Gemini
* **PDF export** for GTU submission

Truth: Most students make PPTs using outdated templates. This fixes that.

---

### 4. **GTU Expert — AI Tutor**

A personalized Q&A system for clearing doubts.

**Capabilities**

* Concept explanations from scratch
* Memory-friendly analogies
* Visual diagrams & infographics (auto-generated)
* A mini quiz (5 MCQs) to test understanding

This turns difficult topics into digestible concepts with a visual twist.

---

### 5. **/humanize (Pro Module)**

Transforms stiff AI text into believable, clean, student-style writing.

**Style Rules**

* No markdown
* No dramatic AI transitions
* First-person narrative
* Natural sentence flow

Harsh truth: This module exists because 90% of students submit AI-text that screams “generated.”

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Frontend**

* React (v19) with TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism UI
* Animated glows, smooth transitions, lightweight components

### **AI Stack**

* **Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai)**
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash** → Reports, Physics JSON, PPT HTML
* **Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview** → Humanization
* **Gemini Flash Image** → Diagrams, infographics

### **Document Generation**

* DOCX via `docx`
* PDF via `html2pdf.js`
* File download via `file-saver`

---

## 🌐 User Experience

A polished student-first interface featuring:

* Central module-based navigation
* Fun UI elements (emoji mascots, glowing backgrounds)
* Real-time feedback messages
* Fast load times even on low-end devices

GTU Copilot isn’t just functional—it’s enjoyable to use.

---

## 🧪 Roadmap (Upcoming)

* GTU syllabus-aware Auto Notes Maker
* Lab Manual Generator
* GTU Past Paper Explainer
* Smart Autosave + Cloud Workspace
* Offline Desktop App

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Harsh Truths

* Students must **replace their own details** in reports.
* Humanized text isn’t magic—it can still be detected if overused.
* Video analysis depends on the video link being publicly accessible.
* Mobile PDF generation can be slower.
